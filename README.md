sanicJIT
============

A toy JIT compiler that wants to go faster

This compiler generates intel x86 opcodes and puts it into an executable buffer. This JIT does all arithmetic with floating point operations

By doing this I can calculate complex expressions **very** fast. (WARNING: doesnt have expression parsing
functionality yet)
